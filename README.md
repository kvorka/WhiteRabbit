Started as a diploma thesis code for computing isoviscous convection in the subsurface oceans. In the process, radially dependent viscosity and visco-elasticity were added in order to compute the icy crust topography inversion and tidal heating. All-in-all, it is still a student project, as I am half way through my PhD at the Departement of Geophysics at the Charles University.

To anyone reading this, I don't know what misery are going through in your life to end this far, but I feel you. Good luck.
